# Data Structures in Java
A repository for implementing major data structures in Java. This project includes classic structures like stacks and queues, with new data structures added as I learn and explore more concepts.

## About
This repository is a personal learning project where I implement essential data structures in Java. The goal is to understand how these structures work under the hood by building them from scratch. I regularly update this repo with new data structures as I progress in my learning journey.

## Features
- Complete implementation using object-oriented programming
- Regular updates with new data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.)
- Clear, beginner-friendly code

## Structures
1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Linked Lists
